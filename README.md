## Features

### Your collection, beautifully presented

Add a cover from your vault or use an image URL. If a book does not have a cover, Ebook Library creates an attractive gradient placeholder with a category icon, so your library never looks unfinished.

Each card shows the information you care about at a glance:

- Title and author
- Category and tags
- Reading or completed status
- Recently opened information

### Simple organization

Give each title the context it deserves with:

- Categories such as Book, Manga, Magazine, Comic, Document, Article, Audiobook, and Other
- Tags with suggestions from your existing library
- Descriptions and ratings
- Unread, Reading, and Completed statuses
- Optional total page counts

### Fast browsing

Use the library toolbar to:

- Search across your entire collection
- Filter by category or tag
- Switch between All, Unread, Reading, and Completed
- Sort by title, author, date added, recently opened, or reading progress
- Choose a compact, comfortable, or spacious card size

### Open and manage your books

Click a cover to open the file in Obsidian. For formats Obsidian cannot display, you can open the file in your operating system's default application. The card menu also lets you edit details, update reading status, reveal files on desktop, or remove an entry without deleting the original file.

### Safe and portable

Ebook Library stores its catalog metadata in Obsidian's normal plugin data. Your book files are not changed, and cover files are referenced rather than duplicated. If you move a cataloged book or cover inside your vault, the library updates its reference automatically.

You can also export your library metadata as a JSON backup from the plugin settings.

## Installation

### From the Obsidian Community Plugins store

1. Open **Settings** in Obsidian.
2. Go to **Community plugins** and make sure community plugins are enabled.
3. Select **Browse**.
4. Search for **Ebook Library**.
5. Select **Install**, then **Enable**.

Once enabled, open the library from the library icon in the ribbon or from the command palette.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest release files: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`.
2. Create this folder in your vault:

   ```text
   <your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/ebook-library/
   ```

3. Copy the three downloaded files into that folder.
4. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins**.
5. Choose **Reload plugins**, then enable **Ebook Library**.

## Getting started

1. Open Ebook Library from the ribbon icon or the command palette.
2. Select **+ Add Book**.
3. Choose a file from your vault.
4. Add a title, author, cover, category, tags, and reading status.
5. Select **Add to library**.

After that, click any cover to open it, or use the search and filters to explore your collection.

## Settings

Open **Settings → Ebook Library** to:

- Rename your library
- Change the card size
- Open the library automatically when Obsidian starts
- Export a JSON backup of your library
- Clear the catalog when you want to start over

Clearing the catalog removes entries from Ebook Library only. It does not delete the underlying files from your vault.

## Privacy and data

Ebook Library is designed to work with the files already in your vault. Book metadata is saved in the plugin's local `data.json` file. The plugin does not upload your library or modify your book files.

External cover URLs are only used when you choose to add a cover from a URL.

## Building from source

This section is for contributors and developers. Regular users do not need to build the plugin.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Use `npm run dev` to rebuild while developing.
